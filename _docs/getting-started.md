### Access
Any LiteBIRD collaborator and external collaborator can be member of the LiteBIRD
GitHub organization. In that case, <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}?{{ site.access_request_template }}">send your github username</a> to get access.


### Policy
Any memeber is free to create repositories inside the organization, the
goal is to maximize code sharing.

Every repository is self-organized and sets its own standards for code quality, validation,
documentation, etc. In particular, developers decide if the repository is public (visible
outside of LiteBIRD) or private.

There is only one rule: no instrument parameter in public repositories.
